You are on the first floor of the Robarts Library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily quiet.
Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands near the
service desk, looking bored and sleepy. There is an empty study room to the South, an exit from the library to the East.
